        <h1>Viva Las Vegas!</h1>
          <p>
          Las Vegas is a city that needs no introduction. It's known around the world as a hub of entertainment, gambling, and excitement, 
          and it lives up to that reputation in every way. Visitors to Las Vegas can expect to be dazzled by bright lights, endless entertainment 
          options, and a level of luxury that's hard to find anywhere else.
          One of the biggest draws of Las Vegas is its casinos. From the classic casinos on the Strip to the more modern resorts like the Bellagio 
          and the Wynn, there's no shortage of places to try your luck. Visitors can play everything from slots to poker, blackjack, and roulette, 
          and the atmosphere is always electric.
          But there's more to Las Vegas than just casinos. The city is also home to world-class restaurants, luxurious spas, high-end shopping, and 
          a wide range of shows and performances. From Cirque du Soleil to world-famous musicians, there's always something happening in Las Vegas.   
          For those who want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, there are plenty of outdoor activities to enjoy as well. Red Rock
